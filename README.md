# PyBank_PyPoll

  This Python challenge was meant to analize bank records and election results. This task was carried out mainly by the use of for loops.

PyBank (part 1):
  In the analysis multiple variables were considered such as net total, changes in Profit/Losses, average changes of those months, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease over the time length given in the csv file. 


PyPoll (part 2):
  In the PyPoll analysis we take a broad look over the election. Our report covers total amount of votes per canidate as well as the overall toal. Additioanly we tally everythimg up to determine who won the election.
